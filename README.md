# photo-tagger

All the photo tagging software I tried either sucked or was horrible.
So I wrote my own using ruby, gtk3, and sqlite.  It works the way I
want to work, and does the things I want it to do.  Most of them,
anyway.  In addition to tagging, it can do lossless rotations, move
photos around, rename directories, and rate photos.  Tags and ratings
can be imported and exported using (hopefully) standard .xmp files.
tagger  works with your photos wherever they are, and won't move anything
unless you tell it to.
